<p>
This website is an educational platform and does not directly provide emergency services.
However, the resources below can connect individuals to official and trained support systems in India.
</p>
<h3>When to Seek Immediate Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you feel physically unsafe</li>
<li>If threats are repeated or escalating</li>
<li>If children are at risk</li>
<li>If you are being prevented from leaving or contacting others</li>
</ul>
<p>
Repeated threats, blackmail, or pressure to stay silent are also forms of abuse.
You can report intimidation even if no physical violence has occurred.
</p>

<h3>Emergency</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>112</strong> — National Emergency Helpline</li>
<li><strong>181</strong> — Women Helpline</li>
<li><strong>1091</strong> — Women Police Helpline</li>
</ul>

<h3>Talk to Someone</h3>
<ul>
<li>iCALL Emotional Support Helpline</li>
<li>AASRA Crisis Support</li>
<li>Mental Health Counselling Services</li>
<li>Trauma and Crisis Intervention Support</li>
<li>Local NGOs and counselling centers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nearby Assistance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nearest Police Station</li>
<li>Government Protection Officers</li>
<li>Women Shelter Homes</li>
<li>One Stop Centres (Sakhi Centres)</li>
<li>Legal Aid Services</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Victims Often Stay Silent</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social pressure and stigma</li>
<li>Financial dependency</li>
<li>Fear of retaliation</li>
<li>Concern for children</li>
<li>Lack of awareness about legal protection</li>
</ul>
<p>
Understanding these barriers is important. Support services are confidential and
designed to help individuals seek safety without judgment.
