    <h3>Know the Signs</h3>
    <p>
        Recognize early warning signs such as repeated humiliation,
        isolation, controlling behavior, or fear-based pressure.
        Abuse is not always physical — emotional and psychological
        harm can be equally serious.

    <h2 class="section-title">Forms of Abuse</h2>
<p class="section-subtext">
Abuse can take many forms beyond physical harm. Understanding these forms helps in recognizing and addressing them early.
</p><br>
    <div class="cards">
<div class="card">
    <h3>Emotional Abuse</h3>
    <p>
        Emotional abuse includes repeated humiliation, insults, isolation,
        or manipulation that gradually affects a person’s confidence and
        mental well-being. It may not leave visible marks, but its impact
        can be deeply distressing.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>Threat & Intimidation</h3>
    <p>
        Intimidation involves creating fear through threats, pressure,
        or blackmail to control someone’s actions or silence them.
        Even without physical harm, fear-based control is a serious
        form of abuse.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <h3>Economic Abuse</h3>
  <p>
    Economic abuse includes controlling access to money,
    property, employment, or financial resources in order
    to make a person dependent and powerless.
  </p>
</div>
        <div class="card">
    <h3>Physical Abuse</h3>
    <p>
        Physical abuse involves the use of force that causes bodily harm,
        pain, injury, or endangers life. Under Indian law, harming a woman's
        health, safety, or well-being within a domestic relationship is a punishable offence.

    <p>
        In recent years, multiple reported cases have highlighted how
        emotional abuse, dowry pressure, and psychological harassment
        can significantly impact victims.
    </p>

            A 29-year-old woman reportedly faced sustained verbal abuse

    <h2 class="section-title">Threat & Intimidation Case: Study 2</h2>

    <div class="case-card">

    <h3>Threat & Intimidation (Psychological Abuse)</h3>

    <p>
        In several well-known Indian cases, intimidation was used to silence
        victims, witnesses, or complainants. Fear, legal pressure, and social
        influence played a major role in obstructing justice processes.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nirbhaya Case (2012):</strong> Witnesses and participants faced fear and pressure during investigation and trial, highlighting the need for witness protection laws. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-nirbhaya-case/articleshow/72868430.cms" target="_blank" class="read-more">Read full case →</a></li>

        <li><strong>Priya Ramani vs M.J. Akbar (2021):</strong> A criminal defamation case was filed after workplace harassment allegations, demonstrating how legal action can be used as intimidation. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/priya-ramani-acquitted-timeline-criminal-defamation-case-filed-against-her-by-mj-akbar-1770193-2021-02-17" target="_blank" class="read-more">Read full case →</a></li>

        <li><strong>Jessica Lal Case:</strong> Witnesses initially turned hostile due to pressure and influence, delaying justice until the case was reopened. <a href="https://thetrustofindia.epaper.timesgroup.com/stories/jessica-lall-murder-case" target="_blank" class="read-more">Read full case →</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
        These incidents show that intimidation can occur through threats,
        power influence, or legal pressure — even without physical violence.
