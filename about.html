    <p>
        This website is an educational awareness project focused on
        understanding domestic violence in the Indian context.
        It aims to explain different forms of abuse, highlight legal
        protections available under Indian law, and guide individuals
        toward official support resources.
    </p>

    <p>
        Domestic violence is not limited to physical harm. Emotional,
        verbal, psychological, and economic abuse can have equally
        serious consequences. Through research-based information,
        real case studies, and structured explanations, this platform
        seeks to promote awareness and early recognition of abusive
        patterns.
    </p>

        and safety.
